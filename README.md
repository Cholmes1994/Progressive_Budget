# Progressive_Budget


# Description

    The budget tracker is a useful application that allows you to add up your income and expenses to obtain a running count of your budget.

    This application is also offline friendly, meaning even if you lose internet, it will still be functional and will be able to cache any input that it receives. Once internet connection is restablished, the cached information will appear on the page like nothing happened.

    This app requires you to install mongoose, morgan, express, compression, and lite-server

    Use npm install to obtain these.

# Usage

    Open the server.js file in the terminal, use the command "node server.js" to start the server, then navigate to your local host 3000 to view the app.
